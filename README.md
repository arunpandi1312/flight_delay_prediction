# flight_delay_prediction
The Flight Delay Prediction Project uses machine learning to predict whether a flight will be delayed based on historical data, including airline, airport, weather, and delay causes. It helps improve travel planning and decision-making for passengers and airlines.

Steps Included in the Flight Delay Prediction Project

1. **Data Collection**  
   Gathered flight delay data with details on airlines, airports, delay causes, and more.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Cleaned and handled missing values, formatted columns, and performed feature engineering.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Applied 30â€“40 EDA techniques to identify patterns and insights.

4. **Feature Selection**  
   Selected relevant features impacting delay predictions for model training.

5. **Model Building**  
   Trained multiple machine learning models to classify flights as delayed or not delayed.

6. **Model Evaluation**  
   Evaluated models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

7. **Model Deployment**  
   Deployed the final model using Streamlit for a user-friendly web interface.

8. **Prediction Interface**  
   Built an interface for users to input flight details and get delay predictions.
